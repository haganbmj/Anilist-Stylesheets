# Anilist-Stylesheets
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/haganbmj/Anilist-Stylesheets.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/haganbmj/Anilist-Stylesheets)

Stylesheets for use with [anilist.co](http://anilist.co).

Feel free to use whatever you'd like in your own stylesheets.

This project makes use of [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), for more information visit their website.

## Compiling
All final `*.css` files will be build in the `css` directory. These are also automatically deployed to the `gh-pages` branch.

```sh
npm install
npm run build
```

## Development
If you would like to fork this and enable travis on your repository, add `GH_TOKEN` as an environment variable in your travis configuration. You can generate a new Github token **[here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)**.
